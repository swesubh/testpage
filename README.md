### **Overview** <hr>
Greetings! I am a highly skilled full-stack developer who is deeply passionate about crafting and designing cutting-edge applications utilizing state-of-the-art technologies, including Microservice Architecture, CI-CD, and Cloud Computing. My proficiency in these areas has enabled me to create highly efficient and cost-effective solutions.

I have a proven track record of delivering exceptional work, such as my successful reinvention of a legacy application for One of the company that I worked for. In this project, I implemented Microservice Architecture, replacing the original Monolith application. As part of this initiative, I designed and developed the Deploy Manager feature, which greatly improved the application's deployment speed and cost-effectiveness. As a result, deployment time was reduced by 90% and costs were lowered by 30%.

Beyond my work with several established company, I have also created a user-friendly JavaScript tool called JSCompiler. It allows users to write quick JavaScript code in their browsers. My expertise extends across multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, React, Angular, SpringBoot, and Nodejs. I am also highly proficient in various CICD tools such as GitLab, Docker, GCP, and AWS. I possess a thorough understanding of RabbitMQ, a message queue software, and I am presently expanding my knowledge base to encompass the basics of Machine Learning.

My "can-do" attitude means that I am highly committed to finding effective solutions to any challenge. I am passionate about exploring new technologies and integrating them into my work, consistently striving to broaden my horizons and develop new skills.

Thank you for reviewing my profile, and I would be honored to connect with you here.
